## Tasks

### M0 Setup (hours 0-4)
- [x] repo, tooling, npm scripts, the `build` branch, the lock, `DEADLINE` and `PROGRESS.md`
- [x] `vercel.json`, `version.json` and the holding page released to `main`
- [x] `ci.yml`, `ios.yml` and `store.yml` committed
- [x] Capacitor iOS shell wrapping the holding page (`ios/App`, `capacitor.config.ts`)
- [ ] push `ios-1` to prove that signing and upload to TestFlight work end to end (tag push blocked, see Blocked below; triggered `ios.yml` via `workflow_dispatch` on `build` instead, awaiting `origin/ci-status`)

### M1 Engine (day 1)
- [ ] full rules of section 4 with starter content: 4 producers, 24 Improvements, 18 Schemes, 8 Hollowell and 8 Candor Agenda cards, and 10 Pressure cards
- [ ] unit tests and the fuzz gate

### M2 Bots and simulation (first half of day 2)
- [ ] RandomBot, HeuristicBot and MCTSBot
- [ ] the simulation harness and the first balance report

### M3 Playable game (second half of day 2 to day 3)
- [ ] the game screen on phone and desktop, and the setup screen
- [ ] Solo and Hot-seat modes, saves and undo
- [ ] enemy turn playback and the rules reference
- [ ] Release to `main`

### M4 Full content and balance (day 4)
- [ ] full card counts and difficulty levels
- [ ] the balance loop run to the targets
- [ ] Release

### M5 Campaign (day 5 to first half of day 6)
- [ ] the scenario system, portraits, scenes and tutorial prompts
- [ ] chapters 1 to 6, with their twists and carry-over
- [ ] Release after chapters 1 to 3, and again after chapters 4 to 6
- [ ] push `ios-<n>` for the first full iPhone build (up to 3 fix builds)

### M6 Polish and store assets (second half of day 6)
- [ ] animations, fixes from the visual review, accessibility and performance
- [ ] web install and offline play; icons, launch screen and haptics
- [ ] the privacy and support pages, store text and screenshots
- [ ] Release, push `ios-<n>`, then push `store-<n>`

### M7 Hardening (final 18 hours; no new features)
- [ ] long fuzz run of 50,000 RandomBot games, full e2e suite on both sizes, final balance report
- [ ] README covering how to play, how to run it locally and how it was built
- [ ] final release and live smoke test, then the final `ios-<n>` build
- [ ] push `submit-<n>` to send that build for App Review
- [ ] final report in `PROGRESS.md`
- [ ] create `DONE`

## Blocked
- Pushing any git tag (`deploy-1`, `ios-1`) fails with `HTTP 403` (RPC failed) from this session's GitHub credentials; `main` and `build` branch pushes work fine. No MCP GitHub tool creates a tag ref either (`create_branch` only creates `refs/heads/*`). Confirmed again on `ios-1` after 3 retries with backoff. Workaround in place (see `DECISIONS.md`): dispatch the workflow directly via `mcp__github__actions_run_trigger` (`run_workflow`, ref `build`) instead of pushing a tag, since `ios.yml`/`store.yml` both also listen for `workflow_dispatch`. `release`'s `deploy-<n>` tag has no such trigger use (it's just a marker), so that one stays untagged; rely on the deploy log plus commit SHAs.

## Deploy log
- `bf1e42c` (holding page, M0 scaffold) — released to `main` 2026-09-24 ~14:00 UTC. Live smoke test passed (`https://cathnivore.com` returned 200, `/version.json` showed the new commit immediately). Tag `deploy-1` created locally but could not be pushed (see Blocked).
