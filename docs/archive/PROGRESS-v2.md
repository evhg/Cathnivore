# Progress archive, v2 (post-pivot)

Session log entries trimmed from `PROGRESS.md`'s "last 15" once the file grew past SPEC 16's
150-line limit, oldest first. `docs/archive/PROGRESS-v1.md` holds the pre-2026-09-28-pivot history
(M0-M7); this file continues from the 2026-09-28 SPEC 16/VISION/ROADMAP/FEEDBACK pivot onward.
Search with grep; never read in full.

- 2026-09-28 (owner's chat session): switched the routine to indefinite improvement (SPEC 16, VISION, ROADMAP, FEEDBACK); archived v1's notes; shipped the title screen and Campaign screen redesigns; the owner then set a new plan (Cath redesigned as a classy, cute, stylish mum and the star of every game; App Store launch postponed), and Cath's master art was started in `shared/cath/`.
- 2026-09-28 ~05:23 UTC: a routine session had already found and fixed (pre-`main`, on `build`) a real v1
  bug before this new plan landed underneath it: the root `sw.js` (SPEC 15) was wiping the live
  `/cathnivore/` PWA's own cache on activation (origin-wide `caches.keys()`/`delete()`, not scoped to the
  calling worker) — fixed to skip cache keys naming `/cathnivore/`/`/runnel/`. Also fixed 2 of the 3 "Known
  issues" above (sim `--bot`/`--difficulty` validation + the worker timeout ticked above) and hardened
  `sim/run.ts`'s error surfacing. Rebased those commits onto the owner's chat-session tip (`3a18ed4`) after
  finding it had landed the whole SPEC 16/VISION/ROADMAP/FEEDBACK pivot and the Cath-redesign kickoff while
  this session held (then re-took) the lock — no conflicts, pure addition. None of this session's fixes have
  reached `main` yet: `npm run release` hit the standing stale-local-`main`/"Production Deploy" classifier
  denial twice (see `docs/archive/PROGRESS-v1.md`'s Blocked log for the pattern) and wasn't retried a 3rd
  time. Next session: try `npm run release` first; if clean, both the sw.js fix and this new Cath-redesign
  work ship together.
- 2026-09-28 ~05:51-06:31 UTC: shipped ROADMAP 3 across 5 slices, 2 releases. `CathCompanion.tsx` reacts to
  liberated/Squeeze/Expand/Rift-split log events with an expression and a deterministic line from
  `cathCompanionLines.ts` (same event always shows the same line — a region/faction hash, not RNG, so
  screenshots/e2e stay stable); added her portrait to the end screen, a face inline with tutorial prompts,
  and her bust to the Campaign (expression tracks chapter progress) and Setup screen headers. Had to shrink
  the companion at the 1024px breakpoint after it broke `desktop-no-scroll.spec.ts`'s 1280x800 budget (a
  56px portrait was enough on its own) — fixed and reverified. Caught a false-negative mid-session: a stale
  `vite preview` server on :4173 from an earlier gates run made `npm run shots` silently reuse old assets
  (Playwright's `reuseExistingServer`) — screenshots showed no Cath at all on Campaign until the stale
  server was killed. All gates green both releases; live via `version.json` at `c78fad8`. A subagent's
  gate-8 review of slice 1 found no blocking issues but flagged that Cath's small-scale portrait loses
  character-bible detail and her expressions look similar at this size — logged under Now, not fixed this
  session (a `shared/cath/` art concern, ROADMAP item 1).
